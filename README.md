# Lab 3 - Java Mini Games

This project was created for Lab 3 using IntelliJ IDEA.  
Author: Berk Enul

It includes two simple games:

- **Number Guessing Game**  
  The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.  
  You have 5 chances to guess.  
  It tells you if your guess is too high or too low.  
  At the end, it shows the correct number and asks if you want to play again.

- **Rock Paper Scissors Game**  
  You play against the computer.  
  Choose: 1 = paper, 2 = scissors, 3 = rock.  
  The game tells who won or if itâ€™s a tie.  
  You can play again if you want.

The project includes comments with Javadoc format, a screenshot, and a working main menu to play the games.

**How to run:**  
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and run `Main.java`.
